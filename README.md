# Interaction Zones Analysis
# 1. ProximityMetrics
This repository contains a Python script to analyze physical proximity between adult and infant during interaction tasks using 3D keypoints extracted from video recordings.

The analysis is based on 3D full-body pose estimations stored in `.npz` files for each frame and each participant.  
The goal is to classify the physical distance between participants into behavioral proximity zones: **Intimate, Personal, and Social**.

---

## üì¶ Dataset Structure

The input folder must contain multiple `.npz` files with the following structure:

- Each `.npz` file represents one frame for one participant.
- Filenames must follow this convention:

```
{FRAME_NUMBER}_{PARTICIPANT}.npz
```

- Example:

```
00001_adult.npz
00001_kid.npz
00002_adult.npz
00003_kid.npz
00004_adult.npz
...
```

- The dataset may contain missing files: some frames may have only adult or only kid files.  
  These gaps are automatically handled by the script.

---

## üîé What the Code Does

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Frame Synchronization

- The script automatically detects valid frames where both adult and kid files are available.
- Frames where either participant is missing are excluded from the analysis.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ 3D Keypoint Processing

- The script loads the `3D_coor_world` array from each `.npz` file (absolute world coordinates).
- It extracts 3 keypoints:
  - **Pelvis** (index `0`)
  - **Left Shoulder** (index `8`)
  - **Right Shoulder** (index `9`)
- The sternum position is approximated as the midpoint between Left and Right Shoulder:

```
Sternum = (LeftShoulder + RightShoulder) / 2
```

- The participant‚Äôs "center of mass" (CM) is then estimated as:

```
CM = (Pelvis + Sternum) / 2
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Distance Calculation

- For each valid frame, the 3D Euclidean distance between adult and kid CM points is computed:

```
D_CM = sqrt((x_adult - x_kid)^2 + (y_adult - y_kid)^2 + (z_adult - z_kid)^2)
```

- This fully takes into account all 3 spatial dimensions.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Behavioral Zone Classification

- The computed distance is classified into 4 proximity zones based on user-defined thresholds:

| Zone       | Distance (meters)   |
|------------|---------------------|
| Intimate   | 0 ‚Äì INTIMATE_THRESHOLD |
| Personal   | INTIMATE_THRESHOLD ‚Äì PERSONAL_THRESHOLD |
| Social     | PERSONAL_THRESHOLD ‚Äì SOCIAL_THRESHOLD |
| Out of Range | Greater than SOCIAL_THRESHOLD |

- The default thresholds are based on literature, but can be adjusted when running the script.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Running the script

Basic usage (with default thresholds):

```bash
python interaction_zones.py /path/to/your/data/folder
```

Example:

```bash
python interaction_zones.py ./dataset/session_01/
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optional: Customize thresholds

You can override the default thresholds directly from terminal:

```bash
python interaction_zones.py /path/to/your/data/folder --intimate 0.5 --personal 1.0 --social 2.5
```

- `--intimate` ‚Üí upper bound for Intimate zone
- `--personal` ‚Üí upper bound for Personal zone
- `--social` ‚Üí upper bound for Social zone

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Output

- The script prints out:
  - Total valid frames analyzed
  - The computed distances and zones for each frame

- A full CSV report `interaction_zones.csv` is saved inside the input folder:

| frame | distance_m | zone |
|-------|------------|------|
| 15    | 0.203      | Intimate |
| 16    | 0.745      | Personal |
| 17    | 1.985      | Social |

---

## ‚ö† Notes

- Only frames where both `adult` and `kid` files are present are analyzed.
- Make sure your filenames strictly follow the `{frame}_{participant}.npz` convention.
- This script works directly on 3D absolute world coordinates (`3D_coor_world`).

---

## üìà Why Use World Coordinates?

- Using `3D_coor_world` eliminates scaling and camera biases.
- Full 3D Euclidean distances allow accurate real-world proximity estimation, even when participants are at different heights or orientations.

---

## ‚úÖ Ready for extension

This code is fully ready for:

- Adding reciprocal facing alignment features (coming next step).
- Integration into longitudinal studies.
- Batch processing across sessions.

# Reciprocal Facing Alignment Analysis

This repository contains a Python script to analyze reciprocal head orientation between adult and infant during interaction tasks, using 2D facial keypoints extracted from video recordings.

The goal is to estimate whether both participants are facing each other during social interaction.

---

## üì¶ Dataset Structure

The input folder must contain multiple `.npz` files with the following structure:

- Each `.npz` file represents one frame for one participant.
- Filenames must follow this convention:

```
{FRAME_NUMBER}_{PARTICIPANT}.npz
```

- Example:

```
00001_adult.npz
00001_kid.npz
00002_adult.npz
00003_kid.npz
00004_adult.npz
...
```

- The dataset may contain missing files: some frames may have only adult or only kid files.  
  These gaps are automatically handled by the script.

---

## üîé What the Code Does

- Automatically detects valid frames where both adult and kid files are available.
- Loads 2D facial keypoints (`2D_coor`) for each participant.
- Estimates head direction for each participant.
- Calculates cosine similarity to determine whether each participant is facing the other.
- Classifies head orientation into behavioral categories.
- Outputs a full CSV report.

---

## üßÆ Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Keypoints used (inside `2D_coor`):

| Landmark   | Index |
|------------|-------|
| Nose       | 24 |
| Left Eye   | 22 |
| Right Eye  | 23 |
| Left Ear   | 20 |
| Right Ear  | 21 |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Head Direction Estimation

- Compute midpoint between ears:

```
ear_midpoint = (left_ear + right_ear) / 2
```

- Compute facing vector:

```
facing_vector = nose - ear_midpoint
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Head Center Position

- Calculate head center as average of 5 facial landmarks:

```
head_center = mean(nose, left_eye, right_eye, left_ear, right_ear)
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Reciprocal Facing Comparison

- Compute vector to the other participant:

```
to_other_vector = head_center_other - head_center_self
```

- Calculate cosine similarity:

```
cos_theta = dot(facing_vector, to_other_vector) / (norm(facing_vector) * norm(to_other_vector))
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Categorization

| Cosine value | Category |
|---------------|----------|
| ‚â• 0.7 | Facing |
| 0.3 ‚Äì 0.7 | Partial |
| -0.3 ‚Äì 0.3 | Perpendicular |
| < -0.3 | Facing Away |
